# Create-your-own-face-database-in-PascalVOC-format-using-face-video
This program uses the frontal face detection using haarcascade for creation of the ground truth boxes around face. 
1. You can create multiple classes for different faces. Just follow the directions mentioned in VOCcreatermultipleclasses.ipynb
2. You can visualise where the bounding boxes are being formed and thus saved in your annotations using view_live.py.
Although, it should be noted that only when a bounding box is formed in the frame, the annotations and images are saved.
